## Projects 🏁🛠️
You can explore my portfolio of projects, which includes:
- [Thermo Racing](https://github.com/PabloH5/Thermo-Racing) - Thermo Racing is an interactive multimedia system designed to aid engineering students in mastering the first and second laws of thermodynamics. This system utilizes gamification and real-time calculations to provide an engaging and practical learning experience through mini-games and competitive Go-Kart racing scenarios. I was part of the team as a developer in karts movement and scrum master.
- [Catzzeria Delivery Service](https://pablitoh5.itch.io/catzzeria) This is a submission for the Game Jam + 24/25. In this 3D game, you take on the role of a cat delivering pizzas on a motorcycle while exploring a city that's randomly generated each game. Enjoy lo-fi music and customize your bike for a relaxing and unique experience. I was part of the project as developer in a random buildings spawn.
